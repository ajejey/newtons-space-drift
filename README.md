# Newton's Space Drift - Educational Physics Game

## About the Game

Newton's Space Drift is an engaging educational game designed to teach Newton's Three Laws of Motion through interactive gameplay. Players navigate a rescue pod through space, saving stranded astronauts while experiencing physics principles in action.

## Educational Value

This game demonstrates key physics concepts including:
- Newton's First Law: Objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force
- Newton's Second Law: Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma)
- Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
- Conservation of Momentum: Total momentum is conserved in a closed system

## Game Features

- Four progressive levels with increasing complexity
- Interactive physics simulations
- Educational overlays explaining physics concepts
- Engaging space rescue missions
- Perfect for middle and high school physics education
